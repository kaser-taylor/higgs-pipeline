# In the process of trying to transform the raw collider data to fit the machine learning model I found I could no longer reliably verify LLM output and the scope of this project was to build a data pipeline. I may return to this when I have better math and physics knowledge

# higgs-pipeline
Personal project focused on ml classification of the higgs boson on LHC data

Necessary imports in top level folder
pandas, 

# ENV SET UP:
1. python3 -m venv .venv
2. source .venv/bin/activate (deactivate to exit)
3. pip install xgboost pandas scikit-learn matplotlib numpy 

got training file set up need to write readme and tune parameters
